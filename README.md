1. Pre-Order and Pick-Up Option
• Feature: Allows users to order ahead for pick-up at a local restaurant, reducing wait 
time and ensuring food is ready when the customer arrives.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: A college student wants to grab lunch between classes. They 
open the Street Eats app, browse nearby street food vendors, and pre-order 
their favorite dish (e.g., a sandwich or chai) for pick-up in 15 minutes. They 
skip the long wait at the vendor and can quickly grab their food when they
arrive.
o Benefit for Vendors: Street food vendors can better plan their inventory and 
avoid making food ahead of time that might go to waste. They can also serve 
more customers in a short amount of time.
2. Loyalty Programs
• : Offers loyalty points for every purchase, which can be redeemed for free items, 
discounts, or exclusive offers.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: A user orders from the same street food vendor multiple 
times. With each order, they earn loyalty points (e.g., 1 point for every ₹50 
spent). Once they accumulate 10 points, they receive a free drink or discount 
on their next meal.
o Benefit for Vendors: Vendors can encourage repeat business and customer 
loyalty, even with low-cost items. Loyalty programs can make customers feel 
appreciated, increasing the likelihood they will return.
3. Group Ordering
• Feature: Allows users to place a single order for a group, where friends can add 
items to the cart and split the bill evenly.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: A group of friends at a college campus wants to order street 
food together. They use the Street Eats app to select dishes from various 
vendors. Each person adds their choice to a shared cart, and the app 
automatically splits the total cost among them. When the order is ready, 
they can pick it up or opt for delivery.
o Benefit for Vendors: Group ordering boosts order sizes and encourages 
customers to buy more, increasing sales. It also makes ordering simpler for 
customers who are eating with friends.
4. Social Features (Sharing & Gifting)
• Feature: Lets users share loyalty points or even gift food items to friends, creating a 
fun and social experience around food ordering.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: After enjoying a delicious meal, a user can send a "gift" to a 
friend (e.g., a free dish or discount) using loyalty points they’ve earned. 
Alternatively, a user can share a review or recommendation about their 
favorite vendor, which encourages others to try it.
o Benefit for Vendors: Social features can help vendors grow their customer 
base through word of mouth. The ability to share and gift food also makes the 
experience more engaging, particularly among younger customers who enjoy 
the social aspect of dining.
5. Real-Time Menu Updates
Feature: Vendors can update their menus in real-time, letting customers know 
what items are available or unavailable.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: A street food vendor runs out of a popular item, like a specific 
sandwich or snack. The vendor updates the menu on the Street Eats app in 
real-time, so customers don’t waste time trying to order something that’s 
unavailable. They can also highlight special offers or dishes of the day.
o Benefit for Vendors: Vendors can avoid frustration by ensuring customers 
know what's available before they place an order. This helps manage 
customer expectations and reduces wasted orders.
6. Vendor Discovery Based on Location
• Feature: Helps users discover local restaurants and food spots that are popular or 
near them.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: A user opens the Street Eats app and is automatically shown 
nearby vendors based on their location (within 1-2 km). They can see ratings, 
popular dishes, and current offers. The app can highlight special deals, 
such as discounts for first-time customers, or show popular dishes in a 
neighborhood.
o Benefit for Vendors: Local vendors get visibility from new customers who 
are nearby and might not have otherwise discovered them. This encourages 
impulse purchases and helps vendors attract more foot traffic.
7. Affordable Delivery Solutions
• Feature: Offers a delivery option, but with the cost-effective model that ensures 
lower delivery charges compared to third-party apps.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: Instead of relying on expensive third-party delivery services 
like Zomato or Swiggy, Street Eats could create a shared delivery network
where multiple vendors use a common delivery person (like a local college 
student or independent driver) to deliver food to nearby areas.
o Benefit for Vendors: Vendors save on high commissions from third-party 
delivery platforms, and customers get a more affordable delivery option. This 
solution can be more efficient in hyperlocal areas (like near a campus).
8. Instant Notifications for Offers and Updates
Feature: Sends push notifications about deals, discounts, and new menu items, 
creating urgency for customers to order.
• Example for Street Eats:
o How it works: When a street food vendor has a limited-time offer (e.g., a 
special dish on discount for a few hours), the app sends push notifications to 
users who are nearby. This encourages them to act quickly and order before 
the offer expires.
o Benefit for Vendors: Vendors can drive quick sales and create urgency. 
Customers are also more likely to check the app regularly if they know they’ll 
get alerts about their favorite street food vendors.
